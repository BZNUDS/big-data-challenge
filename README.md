# My big-data-challenge Homework

GRADER PLEASE NOTE: I submitted to get in the grading que. I heard the graders have lots to do and I don't want to push my final homework assignment at the last minute so they don't get more overwheled the last couple of days. I still need to update my README.md file plus copy over my colab file without the passowrd for the Amazon 'Wireless' .ipynb. It should be completed by 061222 at the latest. Feel free to ask if you have questions.
